Web Scraping Google Places for Hotels
Description:
This Python script uses Selenium to perform web scraping on Google Places to extract information about hotels. It prompts the user for a keyword, searches Google for places, clicks on "More places," and extracts hotel details from the search results. The data is saved in Excel files for each page of results, and pagination is handled dynamically.
