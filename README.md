# Web_scraping

1. Web Scraping Google Places for Hotels
    Description:
    This Python script uses Selenium to perform web scraping on Google Places to extract information about hotels. It prompts the user for a keyword, searches Google for 
    places, clicks on "More places," and extracts hotel details from the search results. The data is saved in Excel files for each page of results, and pagination is 
    handled dynamically.
2. Facebook Marketplace Alert Monitor
    Description:
    This Python script uses Selenium and the Chrome WebDriver to create a monitor for Facebook Marketplace. The script reads data from a CSV file to search for specific 
   products in a defined location, within a specified price range and distance radius. It then creates or updates an alert based on the search criteria to notify the 
   user of relevant listings on Facebook Marketplace. The monitor is run as a class, making it easy to manage and execute on-demand.
